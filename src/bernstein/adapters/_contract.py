"""Adapter contract loader and capability checker.

For every Bernstein adapter we ship a YAML contract under
``tests/contract/contracts/<adapter>.yaml`` describing the *required*
surface of the upstream CLI binary - the flags and subcommands the
adapter always passes when it invokes the CLI.

This module loads those contracts and asserts the local binary's
``--help`` output still advertises every required token. When a secret
named by ``auth.secret_env`` is set and the contract lists required
models, we additionally run the CLI's configured model-list command
and check each entry of ``expected_models.required_present`` appears.

Design notes (refined per issue #1291):

* **Capability assertions only.** We do not snapshot ``--help`` output.
  Upstream CLIs reshuffle their help text frequently; a literal-byte
  diff produces noise that overwhelms the rare real regression.
* **Drift is a hard fail.** Missing required flag -> exit 2. There is
  no daily-batched "auto-fix" PR.
* **No new repo secrets required.** Adapters whose model-presence check
  needs a secret degrade to help-only coverage when the secret is
  absent; the workflow records that fact for operator visibility.
