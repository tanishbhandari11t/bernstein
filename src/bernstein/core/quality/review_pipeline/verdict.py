"""Aggregation rules for the review pipeline.

A stage produces one :class:`AgentVerdict` per agent; the stage's
:class:`AggregatorConfig` decides how to fold them into a
:class:`StageVerdict`.  The pipeline then folds stage verdicts into a
final :class:`PipelineVerdict`.

Strict-superset rule: a 1-stage / 1-agent pipeline using ``strategy=any``
reproduces today's single-pass cross-model verifier behaviour.
