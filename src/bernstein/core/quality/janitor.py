# --- Attribution (item 15 + S2 family) ---
#
# The janitor historically judged a task purely by evaluating its completion
# signals against the SHARED repo state. Two failure modes fell out of that
# (proofs/d2/minimax/attempt-e938bd33 + S2 orphan family):
#   1. Misattribution: a 0-file manager task got janitor_passed=true because a
#      CHILD task's landed work satisfied the manager's signals, while the
#      backend task that made the real green commit (b9574d9) was judged
#      against the wrong repo snapshot and failed.
#   2. Rubber-stamped orphans: crash-recovery auto-completions with an empty
#      diff ($0 / 0 tokens, no commits) were accepted because "no failing
#      signal" was treated as "passed".
#
# Fix: before accepting, attribute concrete work to THE TASK BEING JUDGED --
# commits whose message references the task id, falling back to changed files
# in the task's owned_files -- and REJECT any non-no-op task with an empty
# attributed diff. Attribution inputs/outputs are logged on every verdict so
# a future misattribution is a log read, not a proof-archive autopsy.

# Task types that legitimately produce no diff (research/exploration output
# lives in task notes, not the repo). Everything else must show work.
#
# TaskType.UPGRADE_PROPOSAL is included because verify_upgrade_task() (see
# the UPGRADE_PROPOSAL branch above) is the real pass/fail authority for
# these tasks. Their owned_files name the category's config/template targets
# (collision-guard scope, issue #3398), not a commit-attribution source, so
# the generic empty-diff guard would still hard-reject an already-verified
# upgrade proposal.

    For upgrade proposal tasks, performs additional upgrade verification.

    Args:
        tasks: Tasks to evaluate.
        workdir: Project root for path resolution.
        server_url: Optional task server URL for auto-creating fix tasks.
        guardrails_config: Guardrail configuration. Defaults to GuardrailsConfig()
            (all checks enabled). Pass None to disable all guardrails.
        permission_mode: Permission mode string (bypass/plan/auto/default).
            When ``"bypass"``, non-immune guardrail checks are relaxed.
        judge_model: Optional model override for llm_judge signal evaluation.
            Falls back to the operator's ``bernstein.yaml`` judge_model, then
            to ``JUDGE_MODEL`` as a last resort.
        judge_provider: Optional provider override for llm_judge signal
            evaluation. Same fallback order as ``judge_model``.
        ladder: Optional verifier-ladder context (#2927). When supplied,
            every tier that executed for a task seals a ``TierRecord`` into
            the ``verifier-ladder`` lineage spine and the composite
            ``LadderReceipt`` hash is returned on
            ``JanitorResult.ladder_receipt_hash``. Default ``None``: nothing
            is sealed and janitor behaviour is unchanged.
        lineage_audit_chain: Optional authenticated audit-chain source for the
            LineageGate/tool-call coupling. When supplied, a signed lineage
            entry without matching identity-valid dispatch evidence blocks the
            janitor verdict. ``None`` preserves legacy/audit-disabled behavior.
        lineage_operator_secret: Optional HMAC secret for the ordinary signed
            lineage checks performed by that coupled gate.

        List of JanitorResult for each evaluated task.

# Agent worktrees live under ``<workdir>/.sdd/worktrees/<session>/`` (legacy)

# run. A filesystem signal whose path points inside one of them (managers
# routinely emit the path the agent reported, which is worktree-absolute) only
# proves the agent wrote the file at some instant -- not that the git-based
# merge-back delivered it to the operator checkout. If the file is
# gitignore-excluded, merge-back stages nothing, the worktree is deleted, and
# a naive check would still report done/HEALTHY with zero deliverable.
#
# Fix: translate any worktree-internal signal path to its repo-relative form
# and verify THAT against the checkout the janitor was pointed at. Existence
# only inside a worktree never counts as delivered; glob and fuzzy fallbacks
# likewise never match worktree-internal files.

# --- bug 12: janitor branch-check acceptance signals vs actual pushed branch ---
#
# Task acceptance signals of type ``test_passes`` are sometimes generated as
# git branch/commit checks, e.g. ``git rev-parse --verify fix-905-x`` or
# ``git log -1 --format=%s fix-905-x | grep -q '#905'``. The branch name
# baked into the signal comes from a slugifier at task-generation time
# (hyphen-separated), while the agent that actually does the work is free to
# choose its own branch name and conventionally uses a slash after the type
# prefix (``fix/905-x``, ``feat/905-x``). When the two diverge, the literal
# shell command fails even though the agent's work (including the pushed
# branch and PR) is real -- bernstein records its own success as a failure
# and DLQs the task. See work/agent-reports/2026-07-02-run9-attempt9-audit.md
# (task d56c18f2fc08): expected ``fix-905-demo-worker-record`` (hyphens),
# agent pushed ``fix/905-demo-worker-record`` (slash); PR #965 was open and
# real the entire time.
#
# Fix: for git branch/commit-check commands, resolve the referenced token
# against branches that actually exist (local + remote-tracking), tolerant
# of slash-vs-hyphen drift, and rewrite the command to the ref that was
# actually found before running it. Every resolution attempt is logged at
# INFO with the expected ref(s), the branches actually found, and the
# verdict + reason, so a future mismatch is a log read, not a DLQ mystery.
