"""Receipt-backed fleet steering for running workers (#2508).

Once a worker is running a task an operator has no mid-task controls: no
pause, no way to queue guidance, no redirect of the objective, no clean
abort. Any ad hoc intervention (editing files under a worker, killing a
process) leaves no record, so an audited run a human touched can no longer
be explained end to end. This module closes that gap without weakening the
run's verifiability.

The shape is deliberate: **a steering action is a receipt first and an
effect second.** Each command is bound into the HMAC audit chain via
:func:`~bernstein.core.security.audit_chain.record_steering_receipt` before
any effect runs, and the delivered effect references that receipt's chain
HMAC. Delivery rides the existing task mailbox journal
(:mod:`bernstein.core.communication.task_mailbox`) as the ``steer.*``
message kinds, so queued guidance reaches the worker in chain append order,
exactly once, even mid-tool-call. The worker records each consumed steering
message as a first-class step in the per-step journal
(:mod:`bernstein.core.persistence.journal`), so a steered run replays
byte-identically and divergence detection distinguishes an operator-steered
run from a tampered one.

Strip the chain and this is a control channel with a log. Keep it and every
intervention is a signed, position-fixed receipt whose effect cannot precede
it: an effect without a matching receipt is rejected, mutating a recorded
payload breaks verification at exactly its chain position, and the receipt
binds the exact command payload the operator confirmed. That coupling is the
point.
