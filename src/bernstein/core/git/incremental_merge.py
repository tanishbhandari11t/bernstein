"""Incremental merge support for long-running agents.

Allows an agent to merge a subset of its completed files into the main branch
*before* the full task finishes.  A test-writing agent can push the first five
test files while still writing the remaining five, reducing wall-clock time.

Public API
----------
- :func:`incremental_merge_files` - merge specific committed files from an
  agent's branch into the current branch of the main repo.
- :func:`get_incremental_merge_state` - read which files have already been
  merged for a given session.
- :class:`IncrementalMergeResult` - result of a single partial merge.
- :class:`IncrementalMergeState` - cumulative state across all partial merges
  for one agent session.

Design notes
------------
The merge is performed by running ``git checkout agent/<session_id> -- <files>``
in the *main* repo (not the worktree).  This copies the exact file contents
from the agent's branch without triggering a full merge commit.  A follow-up
``git commit`` records the snapshot with a descriptive message.

Files that have not been committed to the agent's branch yet are returned as
``uncommitted_files`` and skipped - the agent must commit them in its worktree
first.  Already-merged files (recorded in the state file) are also skipped to
prevent double-merging.

State persistence
-----------------
Merge state is written to ``.sdd/runtime/incremental_merges/<session_id>.json``
so it survives server restarts and can be consulted at final-merge time to
avoid re-applying already-merged changes.
