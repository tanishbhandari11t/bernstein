"""Scope, gates, and the receipt a passing volunteer run produces.

A diff exists.  The question this module answers is whether it may become a
submission, and the answer is either a signed receipt bundle or a refusal
record -- never both, and never something in between.

Three things have to be true, in this order, and the order is the point.

*The patch stays inside the paths the project declared.*  Checked before any
gate starts.  A gate is a command of the project's choosing running on a
donor's machine; a patch already known to be out of scope must not buy the
right to execute anything.

*Every gate the manifest declares passes.*  The project's gates, as argv,
under a wall clock the sandbox profile fixes -- not bernstein's own quality
pipeline, which is configured against a ``.sdd`` runtime a stranger's project
does not have.

*Only then is a bundle assembled.*  A failure produces a refusal record and no
bundle at all.  There is deliberately no "bundle marked failed": a signed
bundle is a claim that the work is acceptable, and an artefact whose
acceptability hides in a boolean field is one careless reader away from being
treated as a pass.

Why scope enforcement needs two different helpers
-------------------------------------------------

``allowed_paths`` is a glob list, and matching it is
:func:`~bernstein.core.path_scope.paths_outside_scope`'s job, reached through
:meth:`~bernstein.core.volunteer.manifest.VolunteerManifest.paths_outside_scope`.
That answers *"does the declared policy admit this spelling?"* and nothing
else -- deliberately, since the same question is asked of an agent
credential's ``allowed_files`` and the two must not diverge.

It is not the whole question here, because a patch path is a string a model
wrote after reading a stranger's issue text, not a string ``git diff`` was
observed to print.  Two shapes pass a glob check and still name a file the
project never admitted:

* ``docs/../src/secrets.py`` matches the glob ``docs/**`` -- the matcher
  compares path *spellings* and does not resolve ``..``, which is correct for
  a matcher and fatal for a caller that stops there;
* ``src/plugins/x.py`` matches ``src/**`` while ``src/plugins`` is a symlink
  out of the worktree, so the write lands somewhere the glob never described.

Both are the filesystem containment barrier's department, so
:func:`~bernstein.core.security.path_containment.validate_relative_path` runs
before the glob check and
:func:`~bernstein.core.security.path_containment.contained_subpath` runs after
it, against the real worktree.  Neither is re-implemented here; a second
opinion about what ``..`` means is how the two surfaces drift apart.

The order of the three refusals is also deliberate.  A traversal or a symlink
escape is an attack signal and is reported as one; being outside
``allowed_paths`` is an ordinary mistake a contributor can fix.  Reporting the
ordinary one first would bury the interesting one.

What this module does not do
----------------------------

It does not run the adapter, clone anything, or sanitise issue text -- those
are the runner's, and they hand it a patch.  It does not re-verify from a
clean room: #3871 re-runs these same gates from a fresh worktree precisely
because it does not trust this run, and sharing the code would defeat that.
It does not open a pull request; #3872 consumes
:class:`SignedResultBundle` for that.

It does not verify what it produces.  ``manifest_sha256`` is populated here
with the manifest's own digest, which is this side of the contract; making
*verification* compare that field against the manifest at the commit a
submission names is #3911, and until that lands a bundle can verify as
internally consistent while carrying a digest nobody checked against the
project.  Nothing here needs changing when it does -- the field is already
the real digest.
