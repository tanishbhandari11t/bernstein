"""One claimed task, from a repository URL to a diff or a refusal.

Three primitives this program needs already exist and are independently
tested: :func:`~bernstein.core.volunteer.sandbox_profile.build_volunteer_profile`
derives the containment boundary from a project's manifest,
:func:`~bernstein.core.volunteer.wall_clock.run_under_wall_clock` caps and kills
a process tree, and :class:`~bernstein.core.git.worktree.WorktreeManager` builds
an isolated checkout.  Nothing called them together.  :func:`run_claimed_task`
is that wiring, and nothing more -- it adds no containment of its own.

The order is the interesting part
--------------------------------

Deriving the profile is pure and free; fetching a stranger's repository is
neither.  So containment is decided *first*, and a host that cannot contain
this project never pulls the repository onto its disk at all.  A pipeline that
clones first and checks second has already lost the argument by the time it
refuses.

Then: clone under the cap, isolated worktree, prompt written to a *file*,
agent spawned under the cap with an environment built only from the profile,
and finally the diff.

Why this does not call ``CLIAdapter.spawn``
-------------------------------------------

It cannot, and the reason is worth stating rather than working around
quietly.  :meth:`~bernstein.adapters.base.CLIAdapter.spawn` takes no
environment: every adapter builds its own internally, from
:mod:`bernstein.adapters.env_isolation`, whose allowlist exists to carry
*provider credentials* into an adapter process.  That is the opposite of what
this boundary wants.  ``spawn`` also owns its own ``Popen``, and
``run_under_wall_clock`` owns its ``Popen`` end-to-end, so the two cannot be
composed either.

So the runner owns the spawn.  Both properties then hold by construction
instead of by convention: one process, started by the wall clock, with an
environment built only from
:func:`~bernstein.core.volunteer.sandbox_profile.sandbox_env`.  Widening the
adapter interface to accept an environment would touch every adapter and is a
separate change.

The seam is :data:`AgentArgvBuilder`, and it is handed only a working
directory, a prompt path, a log path and a session id -- deliberately no issue
text.  A builder therefore cannot put untrusted text into an argument vector
even by accident.  :func:`mock_agent_argv` is the zero-key builder used by
tests and demos.

What "inside the sandbox" means here, and what it does not
----------------------------------------------------------

A profile decides four things: backend, egress, environment and resources.
This module applies two of them -- the environment the process gets, and the
wall clock it runs under -- and it applies them to a process started on the
host, in the isolated worktree.

It does not place that process inside the backend the profile selected.
Doing so means standing up a sandbox through
:mod:`bernstein.core.sandbox`, mounting the worktree into it and collecting
the result back out, which is a different change against the backends rather
than the wiring between these three primitives.  Until that lands, a run on
this path is contained by an environment with no credentials and a cap that
kills the process tree, and it is *not* contained by a kernel boundary.

Said plainly because the alternative is worse: a caller who reads "runs inside
the volunteer sandbox" and gets process-level isolation has been told something
untrue, and containment claims are the one thing this program cannot be loose
about.  :func:`~bernstein.core.volunteer.sandbox_profile.backend_options`
already translates the profile into backend configuration; nothing here
consumes it yet.

One budget for the whole run
----------------------------

A donor lends their machine for N minutes, not N minutes per phase.  A ceiling
applied per phase would let a run with an agent phase and *k* gate phases hold
the machine for (k+1)xN, which is not the promise anybody made.  So
:class:`WallClockBudget` starts at the profile's ceiling and is spent down
across clone, spawn and -- for the caller that continues this pipeline into
gates -- everything after.  A caller may pass a budget that is already running;
it is clamped to the profile's ceiling, so a caller can tighten the loan and
never loosen it.

What the caller gets
--------------------

:class:`TaskDiff` on success, :class:`TaskRefusal` on anything else.  No step
raises at the caller: a refusal is the normal outcome on a heterogeneous donor
fleet, and one that arrives as a value gets counted, where one that arrives as
an exception gets caught by whoever guessed right.

Scope: this module stops at the diff.  Enforcing the manifest's
``allowed_paths`` against it, re-running the project's gates, and assembling
the receipt bundle are the next step in the program and consume
:class:`TaskDiff`.  Cleaning up the worktree is the caller's too -- the diff's
provenance is that worktree, and deleting it here would destroy the thing the
next step verifies against.
