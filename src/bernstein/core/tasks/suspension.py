"""Durable task suspend and resume: attested park receipts (#2552).

A long agent session that must wait on a human -- a mid-flight approval, an
external review, a credential rotation, a dependency landing -- has no way to
stop consuming infrastructure. The pre-spawn approval gate halts a task only
before a worker exists; the post-completion review gate only after it exits;
orchestrator holds stop the orchestrator, not a live worker. So the process,
its worktree sandbox, its parallelism seat, and its budget-envelope reservation
all stay allocated for the entire wait. On a capped pool that reservation
blocks other tasks from dispatching.

This module makes the *suspension itself the artifact*. A park is a pair of
Merkle-chained journal rows plus matching HMAC audit-chain receipts, and every
infrastructure release hangs off the suspend receipt's hash. Without the chain
there is no suspension, only a dead process:

* **The suspend row is the identity.** :func:`record_task_suspension_row`
  appends a suspend row to the task's event journal
  (:class:`~bernstein.core.replay.journal.EventJournal`) with the same row
  discipline as the checkpoint substrate: adapter-native session id, a
  workspace hash over the worktree, the journal head, and the envelope balance
  at park time. The row's ``event_hash`` is the suspension's identity.
* **The receipt binds the hash before any effect.**
  :func:`bernstein.core.security.audit_chain.record_task_suspension` binds that
  hash into the HMAC chain *before* the process is reaped, the sandbox is torn
  down, the seat is returned, or envelope headroom is released. Each release
  references the suspend receipt's own HMAC; :func:`release_resources` refuses
  to run any effect without it (:class:`ReleaseWithoutReceiptError`), fail
  closed.
* **Resume is a deterministic projection.** :func:`decide_resume` reuses the
  checkpointed-retry decision (:func:`~bernstein.core.tasks.checkpoint_retry.decide_retry`):
  same workspace hash and a live native session gives ``warm``; a stale session
  or drifted workspace downgrades to ``fork`` or ``cold`` with a recorded
  reason, never silently. Two hosts with the same suspend row and adapter
  capability derive the byte-identical decision, including its ``decision_hash``.
* **The receipt pair is the continuity proof.**
  :func:`verify_suspension_continuity` checks, offline from a copied chain,
  that a resumed task continued from exactly the parked workspace hash, or
  reads the recorded fork/cold downgrade with its reason. Mutating the suspend
  row after the fact fails journal verification at that exact chain position,
  and unrelated evidence (a resume receipt hanging off another park, a receipt
  naming a row the journal never held, a park settled twice) is refused rather
  than reported as verified. A park that has not settled yet reports
  ``pending`` rather than failing: a live park is an incomplete lifecycle, not
  a broken proof.
* **A receipt only counts for the park it binds.** Every release and every
  resume resolves the claimed ``task.suspend_receipt`` on the chain and checks
  it names this task and this suspend row (:func:`verify_suspension_receipt`)
  before it mutates anything, so a substituted receipt cannot drive a state
  change. The approval wake gate is enforced in :func:`resume_task` itself,
  and a ``task_id`` that is not a plain identifier never reaches a filesystem
  name.

Scope relative to steer.pause (#2508) and the receipt-gate at
:func:`~bernstein.core.orchestration.steering.consume_steering`: steer.pause is
the momentary in-place halt for quick correction; this is the durable variant
that frees infrastructure and proves continuity. Both share the checkpoint row
shape and the receipt-before-effect rule.

    * **A claim is either identifier, not both.** A record that references the
