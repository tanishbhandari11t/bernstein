"""Guard against issue #3005: shipped docker-compose files invoking a
``bernstein`` CLI subcommand that does not exist (e.g. the historical
``python -m bernstein.cli server`` / ``bernstein cluster server``).

For every compose file this repo ships as an operator-facing example or
deployment, this resolves the effective container entrypoint for each
service, and - for services whose container execs the ``bernstein`` binary -
walks the resulting argv against the *real* Click command tree defined in
``bernstein.cli.main``. A future rename of a subcommand (e.g. ``serve`` ->
``server``) without updating these files fails this test instead of silently
shipping a container that crash-loops on first ``up``.
