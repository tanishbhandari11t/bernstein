# Lineage v1 - user reference

Lineage v1 is Bernstein's per-artefact transparency log. Every agent write
to a tracked file produces an append-only, content-addressed, Ed25519-signed
entry that an external auditor can verify without any Bernstein install.

This page is the **user-facing** reference. For the design rationale see
[ADR-009](decisions/009-lineage-v1.md).

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What gets logged? | Every agent write to a tracked file or config. |
| How is an entry keyed? | By an [artifact key](lineage/artifacts.md): a repo-relative path, or a `pr://` / `pkg://` / `deploy://` / `doc://` URI. |
| Where does it live? | `.sdd/lineage/log.jsonl` (append-only) + per-entry detached JWS sidecars. |
| Who signs? | The agent itself, with an Ed25519 key issued at spawn time. |
| Who verifies? | Anyone with `bernstein-verify` (a standalone PyPI wheel). No Bernstein install required. |
| What gets shipped to auditors? | `bernstein compliance pack` - a single self-contained ZIP. |

## Quickstart

### Enable lineage

Lineage is on by default (since 1.10.9). To confirm:

```bash
bernstein config get lineage.enabled
# true
```

By default `lineage.strict` is `false`, so lineage failures warn but don't
block writes:

```bash
bernstein config get lineage.strict
# false
```

Once your team is confident, flip to strict:

```bash
bernstein config set lineage.strict true
```

### View the log

```bash
# Full chain for one artefact
bernstein lineage chain src/payments/flow.py

# Walk the ancestry of one artefact
bernstein lineage walk src/payments/flow.py

# Active forks (none should exist on a clean main)
bernstein lineage forks
```

### Generate a compliance pack

```bash
bernstein compliance pack \
  --since 2026-01-01 --until 2026-03-31 \
  --org "Acme Bank" \
  --output ./acme-q1-evidence.zip
```

Pack contents:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Cover page. |
| `article12-evidence.csv` | Machine-readable: every artefact write, agent, ts, content hash. |
| `lineage-log.jsonl` | Raw log slice for re-verification. |
| `signatures/` | Per-entry detached JWS. |
| `agent-cards/` | A2A v1.0 Agent Cards seen during the window. |
| `pack-manifest.json` | Provenance: who packed, when, hashes. Operator-signed. |
| `verify-instructions.md` | One-pager for the auditor. |

## Auditor flow

The auditor never has to install Bernstein. They install one tool:

```bash
pipx install bernstein-verify
```

Then point it at the pack:

```bash
bernstein-verify pack ./acme-q1-evidence.zip
```

Exit code semantics:

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | All signatures valid, chain complete, no unresolved forks. Pack PASSES. |
| 1 | Any failure. Human summary on stdout, structured JSON on stderr. |

Sub-commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bernstein-verify pack <zip>` | Full pack verification end-to-end. |
| `bernstein-verify chain <path> --lineage-dir DIR` | Single artefact chain. |
| `bernstein-verify forks <path> --lineage-dir DIR` | Report unresolved forks (CI use). |

The verifier is air-gap-safe - no network calls, no remote registry
lookups. Every public key it needs is in `agent-cards/` inside the pack.

## Article 12 paragraph mapping reference

EU Regulation 2024/1689 Article 12 paragraph numbers → what in the pack
satisfies them.

| Paragraph | Obligation | Pack artefact | Pack location |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12(1) | Automatic recording over lifetime. | The lineage log itself. | `lineage-log.jsonl` |
| 12(2)(a) | Traceability appropriate to intended purpose. | Each entry carries `artefact_path`, `content_hash`, `agent_id`, `ts_ns`. | `lineage-log.jsonl` + `signatures/` |
| 12(2)(b) | Identification of risk situations / substantial modifications. | Entries whose narrative changes risk parameters. | `article12-evidence.csv` (filter on artefact_path) |
| 12(2)(c) | Post-market monitoring (re. Article 72). | Cross-link via `tool_call_id` to audit log. | `lineage-log.jsonl` (tool_call_id column) |
| 12(2)(d) | Monitoring per Article 14(3) human oversight. | Reviewer-agent entries. | `lineage-log.jsonl` (filter on agent_id) |
| 12(3) | At least 6-month retention. | Pack itself is a retainable artefact; cold-storage path documented. | Pack ZIP + retention chain. |

## Demo bundles

Three reference scenarios ship under `examples/lineage/`:

| Demo | Story | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Fintech | SOC2 + 4 agents editing payments code; rogue parallel-edit detection. | `examples/lineage/fintech/` |
| Healthcare | HIPAA + EU AI Act Article 11 + 12 over a triage config. | `examples/lineage/healthcare/` |
| EU manufacturer | Annex III high-risk machinery; 10-year cold-storage round-trip. | `examples/lineage/eu-manufacturer/` |

Run any of them:

```bash
make -C examples/lineage demo-fintech
make -C examples/lineage demo-healthcare
make -C examples/lineage demo-eu-mfg
```

## Foreign attestations

An external attestation is typed metadata beside a lineage record, never an
entry in Bernstein's HMAC chain.  The first verifier slice accepts a
protocol-neutral envelope containing an issuer, issuer key id, content hash,
claimed subject, trust class, format, and payload hash.  It preserves the
foreign trust class and reports a structurally valid envelope as
`unverifiable` until an issuer- and format-specific verifier is available.

`unverifiable` does not mean Bernstein rejected the foreign claim, and it
does not mean Bernstein verified it.  A malformed envelope fails closed at
`public` trust.  Unknown formats remain `unverifiable` rather than being
parsed as Bernstein data.  Neither result changes whether Bernstein's own
lineage chain verifies or upgrades a foreign claim into a Bernstein finding.

## Failure modes you should know

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `bernstein-verify pack` exits 1 with "fork detected" | Two agents wrote the same artefact in parallel without a Steward merge. | Run `bernstein lineage merge <path>` to record a merge entry; re-pack. |
| `verify` exits 1 with "invalid signature" | The log was edited after the fact, or the Agent Card was swapped. | Treat as a security incident; do not ship the pack. |
| `verify` exits 1 with "kid binding cannot be established" | No Agent Card on disk matches the `(agent_id, agent_card_kid)` the entry signed - typically a card for the entry's key id is missing after a rotation. | Restore the card for that key id under the per-kid layout (see [Key rotation](#key-rotation)); re-verify. |
| `verify` exits 1 with "kid binding mismatch" | An entry's signed body names one key id while its JWS header names another - a key-substitution attempt. | Treat as a security incident; do not ship the pack. |
| `verify` exits 1 with "HMAC mismatch" | Operator HMAC key rotated mid-window. | Re-pack with the correct key context; consult ADR-009 §6. |
| `bernstein lineage gate` reports "non-canonical line bytes" | A `log.jsonl` line's raw bytes differ from the canonical form the writer emits - reordered keys, inserted whitespace, or a stray `\r`. A generic JSONL tool or a hand-edit that pretty-printed or reformatted the log triggers this even when the field values are unchanged. The gate binds verification to the on-disk bytes, so a non-canonical rewrite is rejected rather than silently re-canonicalised. | The log is the provenance anchor and is never edited in place by Bernstein. Restore `log.jsonl` from a trusted copy and re-run; if no trusted copy exists, treat as a tamper incident. |
| `bernstein lineage gate` reports "missing trailing newline" | The final record was truncated or its terminating `\n` was stripped/flipped at EOF (e.g. an editor that drops the trailing newline, or a partial write). | Restore the full log from a trusted copy; a truncated final record is tamper-evidence. |
| Genesis entry shows up with `parent_hashes: []` | First-time write of a file that existed before lineage was enabled. | Expected - see ADR-009 §11 on bootstrap. |

## on_fail recovery receipts

When a workflow DSL DAG routes control to a recovery node because an upstream
node failed under a guard (the `fix-bugs` depends-on `run-tests` with
`condition: "status == 'failed'"` pattern), the recovery task carries a
**lineage-attested failure receipt** rather than a bare description.

The receipt is the recovery task's primary artefact. It captures the failure
the run already observed:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `source_status` | The failing task's terminal status. |
| `condition_context` | The guard evaluation context (`status` / `result` / `output`). |
| `gate_report` | The failing task's quality gate findings. |
| `journal_tail` | The tail of the run's Merkle event journal, filtered to the failing task and stripped of wall-clock envelope. |

The canonical, sorted-key serialization is content-addressed. Recording it on
the run's lineage spine returns a Merkle-chained, HMAC-tagged entry hash, which
is stamped on the recovery task (`metadata.recovery_receipt_hash`) and injected
into the recovery agent's prompt. The recovery agent continues from the
captured failure instead of rediscovering it.

Because the receipt bytes are the spine entry's content, the anchored entry
binds cryptographically to the exact failure summary. Verify that a recovery
task's receipt resolves to a valid spine entry:

```bash
# Resolve the embedded receipt hash against the run's spine.
bernstein lineage verify <run_id> --receipt-hash sha256:<entry-hash>

# Also content-address the receipt artefact against the anchored entry.
bernstein lineage verify <run_id> \
  --receipt-hash sha256:<entry-hash> \
  --receipt-file .sdd/lineage/receipts/<content-hash>.json
```

Exit codes: `0` the receipt resolves on an intact chain (and, with
`--receipt-file`, its content matches the anchored entry); `2` it does not;
`3` the audit key is missing so the chain cannot be verified. Verification
loads the HMAC key read-only and never mints one -- pass `--key-path` to point
at the key the chain was written under.

Guarantees:

- **Determinism.** Two runs over identical fixtures produce a byte-identical
  receipt content hash and an identical spine entry hash.
- **Tamper evidence.** Mutating any receipt field changes the content hash, so
  it no longer matches the anchored entry; rewriting the spine row to cover it
  up breaks the HMAC chain, which needs a key an editor does not have.
- **Isolation.** The receipt's `artifact_path` stays repo-relative
  (`.sdd/lineage/receipts/<content-hash>.json`).

See [on_fail recovery receipts (workflow DSL)](workflows/on-fail-recovery-receipts.md)
for the DAG authoring side.

## Key rotation

Each lineage entry signs the key id (`agent_card_kid`) it was produced under, and the gate verifies the signature against the Agent Card for that exact `(agent_id, kid)` pair - not against whatever card currently sits at the agent id. This keeps historical entries verifiable after an agent rotates its key.

The gate reads two on-disk Agent Card layouts:

| Layout | Path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Single-card | `<cards-dir>/<agent-id>/card.json` | One key per agent (default). |
| Per-kid | `<cards-dir>/<agent-id>/<kid>/card.json` | Multiple historical keys for one agent, one card per key id. |

To rotate a key without invalidating prior entries, keep the old card and add the new one under the per-kid layout:

```
.sdd/agents/
  agent:claude-worker-3/
    k-2025-01/card.json   # old key - retained so old entries still verify
    k-2025-06/card.json   # new key - signs entries from the rotation onward
```

Entries signed under `k-2025-01` continue to verify against the retained card; new entries under `k-2025-06` verify against the new one. Removing a card for a key id that historical entries still reference makes those entries fail the gate with a kid-binding error.
