# Workflow manifests

**How do I chain agent and shell steps into a repeatable pipeline without
writing a plan YAML by hand each time?**

`bernstein workflow` runs declarative YAML manifests: a small DAG of
`agent` and `command` nodes with dependencies, optional retry loops, and
a `{goal}` placeholder substituted at run time. Two schema flavours are
auto-detected from the same command group - the current YAML manifest
(`nodes:` as a list) and a legacy conditional DAG DSL (`phases:` +
`nodes:` as a mapping) kept for backward compatibility.

## TL;DR

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `bernstein workflow list` | List bundled + project + user manifests. |
| `bernstein workflow run <name> -g "<goal>"` | Execute a manifest. |
| `bernstein workflow run <name> --dry-run` | Print the execution plan only. |
| `bernstein workflow validate <file>` | Validate a manifest (either schema). |
| `bernstein workflow init <name>` | Scaffold a new manifest. |
| `bernstein workflow show <name>` | Inspect a legacy DSL file's phases/edges. |
| `bernstein workflow resume <run_id>` | Resume a killed or interrupted workflow run. |

Manifests resolve from three places, project-local wins:

1. `<project>/.bernstein/workflows/*.yaml`
2. `~/.bernstein/workflows/*.yaml`
3. Bundled `templates/workflows/*.yaml`

## Writing a manifest

```yaml
name: idea-to-pr
description: "Take a goal from idea to merged PR."
version: "1.0.0"

nodes:
  - id: research
    agent: manager
    prompt: "Research the goal: {goal}"

  - id: plan
    depends_on: [research]
    agent: architect
    prompt: "Turn the research brief into a concrete plan for: {goal}"

  - id: implement
    depends_on: [plan]
    agent: backend
    prompt: "Carry out the plan for: {goal}"
    fresh_context: true
    timeout_seconds: 3600

  - id: tests
    depends_on: [implement]
    command: "pytest -x -q"
    timeout_seconds: 1800
```

Node fields (`core/workflows/workflow_spec.py`, `WorkflowNode`):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Slug-shaped, unique within the manifest. |
| `depends_on` | Ids that must finish before this node starts. |
| `command` | Bash command (mutually exclusive with `agent`). |
| `agent` | Role/spec name that dispatches through `AgentSpawner` (requires `prompt`). |
| `prompt` | Prompt body; `{goal}` is substituted from `run(goal=...)`. |
| `loop` | `{until: "<bash predicate>", max_iterations: N}` - re-fires the node until the predicate exits 0 or the cap is hit. |
| `fresh_context` | Agent nodes only: no session carryover between loop iterations. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Per-iteration wall-clock cap (1-86400, default set in `workflow_spec.py`). |
| `interactive` | **Rejected at load time** - see [Limitations](#limitations). |

Bundled examples ship under `templates/workflows/`: `idea-to-pr.yaml`,
`refactor-with-tests.yaml`, `doc-update.yaml`, `hot-fix.yaml`,
`security-review.yaml`, `dependency-bump.yaml`.

## Running

```bash
bernstein workflow run idea-to-pr -g "Add JWT auth"
bernstein workflow run ./templates/workflows/refactor-with-tests.yaml
bernstein workflow run idea-to-pr --dry-run   # print topological layers, don't execute
```

The runner (`core/workflows/workflow_runner.py`, `WorkflowRunner`)
executes the manifest as a topological DAG: every layer of nodes whose
dependencies are satisfied runs concurrently via a thread pool.
Agent-typed nodes dispatch through the existing `AgentSpawner`;
command-typed nodes shell out with `subprocess.run`. Each node's
terminal status is one of `success`, `failed`, or `skipped` (skipped
means an upstream dependency failed). A node with `loop:` re-fires until
its `until` bash predicate exits `0` or `max_iterations` is reached, at
which point the run raises rather than silently truncating.

`bernstein workflow run` exits non-zero if any node ends up `failed`.

## Resuming workflows

Workflow runs can be resumed after interruption (Ctrl+C, crash, kill) using:

```bash
bernstein workflow run idea-to-pr -g "Add JWT auth"  # prints run_id
bernstein workflow resume <run_id> -g "Add JWT auth"
bernstein workflow resume <run_id> -m ./my-flow.yaml
```

The resume command:
- Validates that the provided manifest matches the one used at run start via spec digest
- Loads persisted state from `.sdd/runs/<run_id>/`
- Skips already-completed nodes
- Continues execution from the first non-completed node
- Preserves loop iteration counts when resuming loop nodes

State persistence location: `.sdd/runs/<run_id>/` contains:
- `spec_snapshot.json` - manifest name, version, digest, and source
- `<node_id>.node.json` - checkpoint for each completed node
- `run_complete.json` - sentinel written when run finishes

**Spec digest validation**: On resume, the runner computes a digest of the
provided manifest and compares it to the one recorded at run start. A mismatch
is refused to prevent executing different manifests with the same run ID.

**Loop node resume behavior**: When resuming a loop node, the runner reads
the persisted iteration count and continues from the next iteration, preserving
all loop state.

## Validating and inspecting

```bash
bernstein workflow validate templates/workflows/idea-to-pr.yaml
bernstein workflow list
bernstein workflow list --bundled-only
bernstein workflow init my-flow
bernstein workflow init my-flow --target ~/workflows/my-flow.yaml --force
```

`validate` sniffs the file structurally: `phases:` at the top level
means legacy DSL, a top-level `nodes:` list means the current manifest
schema. The non-matching path imports no schema, so a malformed DSL file
can't crash the manifest validator or vice versa. `init` scaffolds a
blank manifest and round-trips it through the parser before writing, so
the scaffold can never fail its own `validate`.

## Legacy DSL

`bernstein workflow show <name>` inspects the older conditional-DAG DSL
(`core/planning/workflow_dsl.py`): nodes are keyed by id under a mapping
(not a list), grouped into named `phases:` with `allowed_roles` and
optional `requires_approval`, and edges may carry guard conditions. DSL
files live under `.bernstein/workflows/` and are matched by name only
(no bundled or user-home search path). `workflow list` picks up DSL
files from the same project directory as a best-effort secondary scan;
`workflow validate` and `workflow show` both work against them
directly. New manifests should use the YAML schema above - the DSL path
exists for files written before the YAML manifest schema landed.

## Limitations

- **`interactive: true` is not implemented.** A node with `interactive`
  set is rejected at *load* time with a validation error referencing
  ticket #1110, before any upstream node runs. The runner also carries a
  defence-in-depth `NotImplementedError` for out-of-band loaders that
  bypass the validator. There is currently no human-approval gate inside
  a workflow run.
- **No per-node adapter/model routing.** Nodes inherit the orchestrator's
  default adapter and model (`bernstein.yaml` top-level `cli:` + role
  policy). To pin a different CLI or model for one step, lift the
  manifest into a plan YAML and use per-step routing instead - see
  [Per-step CLI and model routing](../workflows/per-step-routing.md).
- **Bash-only loop predicates and command nodes.** There is no built-in
  retry/backoff policy beyond `loop.max_iterations`, and command nodes
  have no sandboxing beyond the orchestrator's own worktree isolation.
