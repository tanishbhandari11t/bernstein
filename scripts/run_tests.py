"""Run each test file in a separate subprocess to prevent memory leaks.

pytest keeps references to test objects for the entire session. With 2000+
tests this can grow to 100+ GB. Running each file in its own process caps
memory at whatever a single file needs (~200MB max).

Usage:
    python scripts/run_tests.py              # run all unit tests (parallel by default)
    python scripts/run_tests.py -x           # stop on first failure
    python scripts/run_tests.py -k adapter   # filter by keyword
    python scripts/run_tests.py tests/unit/test_router.py    # run one file
    python scripts/run_tests.py tests/unit/test_router.py::test_pick  # one test
    python scripts/run_tests.py tests/integration          # run one directory
    python scripts/run_tests.py --parallel 4 # run 4 files at once
    python scripts/run_tests.py --parallel 1 # force sequential execution
    python scripts/run_tests.py --coverage   # collect coverage and emit coverage.json
    python scripts/run_tests.py --shard 1/4  # run only shard 1 of 4 (CI fan-out)
